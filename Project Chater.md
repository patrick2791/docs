# Project Charter: DineOps  

## Project Purpose and Justification:
The DineOps ERP System (SaaS) is designed to streamline and optimize restaurant operations through an integrated, cloud-based platform. This system will improve efficiency in managing inventory, orders, billing, staff scheduling, accounting, customer relationships, and analytics. The SaaS model ensures scalability, remote accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and continuous updates, making it ideal for both single restaurants and multi-location chains.
**Objectives**:  
- Replace manual processes (orders, inventory, staff scheduling).  
- Design for scalability (multi-tenant SaaS architecture).  

**In-Scope**:  
- Core modules: POS, Inventory, CRM, Analytics.  
- APIs for third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways, accounting software).  

**Out-of-Scope**:  
- Custom hardware (client provides existing devices).  
- Advanced AI features (phase 2).  

**Milestones**:  
- MVP in 3 months (client testing).  
- SaaS beta in 6 months.  

**Stakeholders**:  
- Client: Restaurant owner, manager.  
- You: Developer, future SaaS customers.
